1. Assign the value 5 to a, and value 6 to b. Assign the value of a + b to variable c.

a = 5	
b = 6
c = 11

2. [MCQ] Which of the following will produce the right result?
2 + 5 produces '25'
'2' + 5 produces '25'
'2' + '5' produces '25'  -- Correct
2 + '5' produces '25'

3. Floating point number is represented with a dot(.) followed by one or more decimals (can be zero).

#Compute the area and perimeter of a circle with radius = 3
pi = 3.14
area = pi*3*3
perimeter = 2*pi*3

4. Numbers that contains decimal point are called floating point numbers. The type(x) function will return if the argument x is a float. You can use the float(x) and int(x) function to convert values between float and integer.

# Change the type of the variable x to float
# Change the type of variable y to integer
x = 123446754336788543835697
y = 3.14159265358979323846
x = float(x)
y = int(y)

5. Declare a string literal by enclosing the literal using single, double or triple quotes. Triple quote allows the literal to span multiple lines.

# Assign foobar which gives the output shown in the last example.
# Hint: Use the triple quote as the outermost quote
foobar = """\"No, thanks, Mom," I said, "I don't know how long it will take.\""""

6. Certain mathematical operations such as addition and multiplication can be used on the String datatype. Study the examples given below to see how it works:

# Assign 'HelloWorld!' to variable a
a = 'HelloWorld!'

# b contains 'HelloWorld!HelloWorld!HelloWorld!HelloWorld!HelloWorld!'
b = 'HelloWorld!HelloWorld!HelloWorld!HelloWorld!HelloWorld!'

7. You can make use of the len(x) function to find out the number of characters in a string.

greeting = "Hello Google!"
# number of characters stored in the variable greeting
number_of_char = len(greeting)

# repeat the greetings based on the number of character in 'greeting'
greetings = number_of_char*greeting

8. Like other programming languages, Python also has some basic types like numbers, strings, lists and dictionaries.

# Assign arbitrary values to the variables such that they are of the types used in the examples
a = 'Hello'
b = 2
c = 2.5
d = [2,3,4]

9. [MCQ] Which of the following are not valid variable names in Python?
a: _hello
b: $hello
c: hello
d: hello world

a and b
a only
d only
a and c
b and d -- Correct

10. A integer or floating-point number with trailing 'j' or 'J' is a complex number.

# Compute the sum and product of 2 complex numbers:
# (2+3j) and (4+5j)
a = 2+3j 
b = 4+5j
sum_ab = a+b 
prod_ab = a*b

11. A string is a sequence of characters.
    Each character can be retrieved using an integer index, starting from zero.
    To access a substring use s[i:j], which returns a substring from index i to
    index (j-1).
    
# Extract each word from 'greetings' and assign to 
# variables 'first', 'middle' and 'last'.
greetings = "How are you"
first  = greetings[0:3]
middle = greetings[4:7]
last   = greetings[-3:]

12. [MCQ] What are the final values of x and y at the end of execution?
          def changeval(x):
                global y
                x = 3
                y = 4

          x = 1
          y = 2

          changeval(x)

          print x
          print y
          
          
x = 1, y = 2
x = 3, y = 4
x = 3, y = 2
x = 1, y = 4 -- Correct
None of the above.

13. [MCQ] What will be printed by the code given below?
>>> type(5/2)

<type 'int'> -- Correct
<type 'float'>
<type 'list'>
<type 'str'>
<type 'tuple'>

14. [MCQ] What is the value of x?
x = 1 == 1 and 1 != 0 or 1 > 0

-1
0
True -- Correct
False
